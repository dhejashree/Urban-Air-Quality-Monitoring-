# Urban-Air-Quality-Monitoring-
Title:AI-Powered Smart Air Quality Monitoring & Prediction System

Abstract:

Air pollution is a critical concern in urban areas, significantly impacting public health and the

environment. This project presents a smart air quality monitoring system that leverages

Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide real-time air quality data and

predictive insights. The system uses low-cost sensors (MQ135, DHT11) connected to a

NodeMCU (ESP8266) microcontroller to measure key environmental parameters such as CO₂

levels, temperature, and humidity. The collected data is transmitted over Wi-Fi to a cloud

platform (ThingSpeak) for real-time visualization and analysis.

To enhance the system's capabilities, an AI model is trained using historical sensor data to

predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) category (e.g., Good, Moderate, Poor). The model is

developed using machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and deployed locally or

on a cloud interface for real-time predictions. This integration allows the system not only to

monitor but also to anticipate potential air quality issues, enabling early warnings and better

decision-making.The project demonstrates a cost-effective, scalable, and intelligent approach to

urban air quality management, suitable for applications in smart cities, residential zones, and

public institutions.

1.Project Demonstration:

Overview:

An AI model is trained to predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) category based on sensor readings.

The system provides real-time monitoring and intelligent prediction, enabling early alerts for

poor air quality.

● System Walkthrough:Collected data is also used to feed a trained AI model that

predicts the AQI category (e.g., Good, Moderate, Poor). The system displays both live

data and predictions, enabling real-time monitoring and early pollution alerts.

● AI Diagnosis Accuracy:AI diagnosis accuracy measures how correctly the model

predicts air quality categories based on sensor data.

● IoT Integration:This enables real-time remote monitoring and data visualization through

dashboards accessible via the internet. IoT integration allows seamless data flow from

physical sensors to online systems for analysis and alerts.
Performance Metrics:evaluate how well the AI model predicts air quality

categories.These metrics are calculated using a test dataset with known labels.They

help identify the model’s strengths and weaknesses for improvement.

● Security & Privacy: Encryption protocols and privacy measures will be explained and

demonstrated as the system handles all the necessary data.

Outcome:

By the end of the demonstration, the system’s ability to handle real-world scenarios, ensure data

security, and data visualization through IoT integration will be showcased.

diagnosis, or usability issues will be addressed.

● Final Testing: After adjustments, the system will undergo final testing to ensure full

functionality, usability, and scalability.

Outcome:

Final adjustments will optimize the system for a broader rollout, ensuring that it is fully ready for

real-world deployment.
